# THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT FORK OF HowDeSBT

# HowDeSBT
Sequence Bloom Tree, supporting determined/how split filters

# Dependencies

* Jellyfish (Version 2.2.0 or later)
* SDSL-lite (Has to be cloned from github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite after
April 2017; earlier versions had a problem with RRR in certain configurations)
* CRoaring (https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring)
* The tutorial makes use of ntCard (https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard)

# Installation

To install HowDeSBT from the source:  

## 1a. Download the latest version of subutan using Github  
```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/medvedevgroup/HowDeSBT  
```  

## 1b. Modify the Makefile

If you have installed the dependencies somewhere other than
<code>${HOME}</code>, you need to modify the Makefile. Specifically, in
both the <code>CXXFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code> definitions
<code>$${HOME}</code> should be changed to your install path.

## 1c. Jellyfish install workaround 

(There are other ways to accomplish this, see the note at the end
of this step.)

Jellyfish installation requires an extra step for its include
directory. After you have installed Jellyfish, do
```bash  
    cd ${HOME}/include
    ls | grep jellyfish
```
You should see something like
```bash  
    jellyfish-2.2.6
```
where 2.2.6 is the version of Jellyfish you've installed. Then make a
symbolic link named 'jellyfish' that points to the includes directory
for the version you've installed:
```bash  
    cd ${HOME}/include
    ln -s jellyfish-2.2.6/jellyfish jellyfish
```

Note: the symbolic link is a workaround for the way that Jellyfish installs
its files. That install expects the user to have the program pkg-config
installed and an environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH defined. The Makefile
here woud then use pkg-config to get the path to the include files. While that
paradigm is apparently widespread it isn't universal. The symbolic link
workaround seems less of a burden than requiring that users install another
package and set up an environment variable. See
https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish/issues/139 for more details.

## 2. Compile:  
```bash  
    cd HowDeSBT  
    make  
```

## 3. Install:  

```bash  
    cd HowDeSBT  
    cp howdesbt ${HOME}/bin
```

Another alternative is to make sure the path to the HowDeSBT directory is in
your PATH environment variable.

## 4. Validation:  

The quick start tutorial shows expected results which can be compared against
your tutorial results.

# Quick Start

A usage tutorial can be found at
https://github.com/medvedevgroup/HowDeSBT/tree/master/tutorial

The command <code>howdesbt ?</code> will show a list of subcommands with brief
descriptions. As of this writing, that will look like this:
```bash  
    $ howdesbt ?
    makebf--    convert a sequence file to a bloom filter
    cluster--   determine a tree topology by clustering bloom filters
    build--     build a sequence bloom tree from a topology file and leaves
    query--     query a sequence bloom tree
    version--   report this program's version

```

The command <code>howdesbt ?\<subcommand\></code> will give a more detailed
description of a subcommand.  For example, <code>howdesbt ?makebf</code>
gives details for how to convert a sequence file to a bloom filter.
